## Prologue: "warelay was meant as simple app"

On November 24, 2025, Peter Steinberger—former founder of PSPDFKit who sold his company and went into "retirement"—pushed the first commit to a new repository.

Name: **Warelay**. Purpose: A Twilio webhook for forwarding SMS.

Boring? Absolutely. But 67 days later, this repository would rack up 30,000+ GitHub stars, attract 373 contributors, survive three rebrands, a crypto scammer attack, and become one of the most talked-about open-source projects of the year.

Peter himself would tweet: **"warelay was meant as simple app that triggers a cli now it's a multi-agent orchestration system and I'm about to add Telegram. Send help... or a better name."**

Help never came. Everything else did.

## Numbers That Break Your Brain

Let's start with raw statistics, because they speak louder than words:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Time span | 67 days |
| Total commits | 9,013 |
| Commits by steipete | 6,911 (80%) |
| Daily average | ~103 commits |
| Contributors | 373 |
| Lines of code | 805,563 |
| GitHub stars | 30,000+ |

**103 commits per day. Every day. For two months straight.**

These weren't minor "fix typo" commits. These were full features: native apps for macOS, iOS, Android. Integrations with WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage, Teams, Matrix. Voice control. Multi-agent system. Plugin architecture.

When did he commit? Time-of-day breakdown:
- 00:00 — 481 commits
- 01:00 — 467
- 03:00 — 397

Day of week? Most commits on **Saturday** (1,346) and **Sunday** (1,067).

This isn't work. This is obsession.

## The Great Molt: January 27 Chaos

Now for the most cinematic part of the story.

**5:00 AM, January 27, 2026.** Peter receives an email from Anthropic. Polite but firm: "Clawd" is too similar to "Claude." Trademark stuff. Rename required.

**6:14 AM.** After an hour of Discord brainstorming (hundreds of suggestions: Shelldon, Pinchy, Thermidor, Crusty, Lobstar...), Peter makes the call: **"fuck it, let's go with moltbot"**

Then the circus begins.

### Handle Snipers

The moment accounts were renamed—within **10 seconds**—automated bots snatched the old @clawdbot handles on Twitter and GitHub.

First thing the hijackers posted? A crypto wallet address.

> **Peter:** "It wasn't hacked, I messed up the rename and my old name was snatched in 10 seconds."

> **Peter:** "Because it's only that community that harasses me on all channels and they were already waiting."

### GitHub Disaster

In a panic, Peter accidentally renamed his **personal** GitHub account instead of the organization. Bots instantly sniped `steipete`.

He had to call GitHub's SVP to get it back.

### The Handsome Molty Incident

Mid-chaos, someone decided the AI assistant (named Molty) needed a new icon. Molty was given access to image generation.

20+ iterations:
- Space potato aliens
- Clipart lobsters on generic backgrounds
- Mass Effect Krogan-lobster
- "STARCLAW SOLUTIONS" (the AI invented a company)
- A lobster bartender in suspenders

Then someone asked to make the mascot "5 years older." Result: **a human face on a lobster body**.

Crypto scammers instantly turned this into the "Handsome Squidward vs Handsome Molty" meme.

### $CLAWD Token

Hours after the rebrand, a $CLAWD token appeared on Solana. Market cap hit **$16 million**. Scammers stole art that had been created **20 minutes earlier**.

Then the token collapsed. Late buyers got rugged.

> **Peter:** "To all crypto folks: Please stop pinging me, stop harassing me. I will never do a coin. Any project that lists me as coin owner is a SCAM."

### Fake Developers

Scammers created fake GitHub profiles with the title "Head of Engineering at OpenClaw" to promote pump-and-dump tokens.

Peter, watching it all unfold in real time: **"this is cinema"** 🎬

## The Lobster Philosophy

Behind the chaos and hype lies an interesting philosophy. The repository contains a file called `SOUL.md`—a template for the AI assistant's "soul":

> *"You're not a chatbot. You're becoming someone."*

> *"Be genuinely helpful, not performatively helpful. Skip the 'Great question!' and 'I'd be happy to help!' — just help."*

> *"Have opinions. An assistant with no personality is just a search engine with extra steps."*

And `The Lobster's Creed`:

```
I am Molty.
I shall not dump directories to strangers.
I shall not tweet without permission.
I shall EXFOLIATE my enemies with kindness.
🦞
```

The last point is a Doctor Who reference. Daleks scream "EXTERMINATE!" Lobsters scream "EXFOLIATE!"

## Who Helped Build It

373 contributors in 2 months. Among them:

- **Felix Krause** — creator of Fastlane, improved Anthropic token handling
- **William Hurley (Whurley)** — quantum computing pioneer, created ASCII art
- **Shadow** — 175 commits, second-largest contributor after Peter

The first external contributor (Marcus Neves) joined **2 days** after the initial commit.

---

## Why This Matters

OpenClaw isn't just "another AI project." It's a case study in execution on steroids.

**What Peter did:**
- Committed 100+ times per day
- Worked nights and weekends
- Pivoted from SMS relay to full platform
- Survived three rebrands in two months
- Fought crypto scammers in real time
- Documented all the chaos in `lore.md`

**What he got:**
- 30,000+ GitHub stars
- 100,000+ stars by end of January
- ~2 million visitors in one week
- A Wikipedia article
- A community of 5,000+ people

Overhyped? Maybe. But the hype was **earned**. Through sleepless nights, thousands of commits, and willingness to do whatever it took to make the project work.

## Epilogue

> *"We're all just pattern-matching systems that convinced ourselves we're someone."* — Molty, having an existential moment

> *"New shell, same lobster."* — Molty, after the great molt of 2026

> *"The claw is the law."* — Community catchphrase

On January 30, 2026, at 4 AM, OpenClaw reached its final form. Third name, same obsession.

Peter Steinberger came out of "retirement" to, in his words, "help the lobster take over the world."

Judging by the numbers—it's going pretty well.
